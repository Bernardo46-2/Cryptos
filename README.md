# Cryptos
Some cryptography implementations in rust

## TODO
- Actually write a readme
- AES GCM next (?)

### Disclaimer
All the implementations are for educational or personal use only and should not be used for any critical or production systems. While I have taken reasonable steps to ensure the correctness of the implementation, there may still be bugs or vulnerabilities. Use at your own risk.
