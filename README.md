# Cryptos
Some cryptography implementations in rust (and maybe some other languages eventually).  
This is mainly for fun and for learning how some cryptography methods works.

## Disclaimer
All the implementations are for educational or personal use only and should not be used for any critical or production systems. While I have taken reasonable steps to ensure the correctness of the implementation, there may still be bugs or vulnerabilities. Use at your own risk.

### Currently implemented:
- AES CBC (128, 192, 256)

### TODO
- All AES modes
- Write a proper random number generator
- Some Hashs.. idk ciphers are cooler
